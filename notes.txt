IRC theory

-an IRC client connect to a server via a TCP socket, generaly on port 6667

-message exchange are done in ascii format ended by \r\n

-main command
	NICK, defines the nickname
	USER, user identification
	JOIN, join a channel
	PRIVMSG, sending  private msg or a message on a channel
	PING/PONG, maintain an active connection

usefull librairies:
		<thread> 
		<sys/socket.h>, <arpa/inet.h>, <unistd.h> to manage socket

What is a socket?
	programming interface to manage app to communicate with each other on a red
	sockket is an in/out  used to send and receive data. It can be implemented as a FD file
	IP adress - port 

type of socket:
	TCP: used for HTTP, FTP based on TCP protocol, garanties that data arrives in order and without loss
	UDP: Used for DNS, streaming, no garanties of order or loss
	UNIX socket: fast communication between process on the same machine
	
programm structure:
	IRC client
		-manage the connection to the sserver
		-send and receive messages
		
	USER interface
		-permits to the user to write commands and prints received message
		
	THREADS management
		-one to listen to the server
		-one for the user entry

Create a Socket: 
	int sock = socket (AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

Connect to Server:
	int sock = socket (AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
	sockaddr_in serverAddr{};
	serverAddr.sin_family = AF_INET; // IPv4
	serverAddr.sin_port = htons(80); // Port 80 (HTTP)
	if (connect(sock, (struct sockaddr*)&serverAddr, sizeof(serverAddr)) < 0) 
	{
    std::cerr << "Error" << std::endl;
    return -1;
	}
	std::cout << "Connected." << std::endl;
	close(sock);

Send IRC command:
	void sendCommand(int sock, const std::string& command)
	{
    std::string cmd = command + "\r\n";
    send(sock, cmd.c_str(), cmd.size(), 0);
	}

Loop to listen to the server:
	void listenToServer(int sock)
	{
    	char buffer[2048];
    	while (true) 
		{
        	memset(buffer, 0, sizeof(buffer));
        	int bytesReceived = recv(sock, buffer, sizeof(buffer) - 1, 0);
        	if (bytesReceived > 0) 
			{
            	std::string response(buffer);
            	std::cout << response;

            // Answer to Ping to maintain connection
            	if (response.substr(0, 4) == "PING") 
				{
                	std::string pong = "PONG " + response.substr(5);
                	sendCommand(sock, pong);
            	}
        	} 
			else if (bytesReceived == 0) 
				{
        	    	std::cerr << "Disconnected form the server." << std::endl;
            		break;
        		}
			else 
			{
            	std::cerr << "Erreur during data reception,." << std::endl;
        	}
    	}
	}

Main function:
	int main() 
	{
    	const std::string server = "irc.libera.chat"; // Exemple of server
    	const int port = 6667;
    	const std::string nickname = "MyNickname";
    	const std::string username = "MyUser";

    // Connection to server
    int sock = connectToServer(server, port);

    // Authentification
    sendCommand(sock, "NICK " + nickname);
    sendCommand(sock, "USER " + username + " 0 * :MyName");

    // Join a channel
    std::string channel = "#my_channel";
    sendCommand(sock, "JOIN " + channel);

    // Send a thread to listen to the server
    std::thread listener(listenToServer, sock);

    // Loop to reaad the messages from the user
    std::string userInput;
    while (true) 
		{
        std::getline(std::cin, userInput);
        if (userInput == "/quit") 
			{
            sendCommand(sock, "QUIT :BYE!");
            break;
        	}
        sendCommand(sock, "PRIVMSG " + channel + " :" + userInput);
    	}

    // clean
    listener.join();
    close(sock);
    return 0;
}

IRC client possibility: HexChat, Irssi, mIRC, WeeChat

Tried with HexChat which is present on 42's computer and I could connect on the server with
    localhost:8912 !!!

nc localhost <port number> is also working

---------------------------------------

to check:
         Nick: in IRC normally must not contain spaces and 9 char max
		 JOIN: add a control because the channelName has to begin with a #, maybe also handle the case of a password to enter a chatroom

using NC(Netcat):
	-to connect:
		nc localhost 8912
Netcat has two working modes:
    Connect mode. In connect mode, Netcat works as a client. The utility requires the <host> and <port> parameters.
    Listen mode. In listen mode, Netcat works as a server. When <host> is omitted, Netcat listens on all available addresses for the specified port.


	-man netcat
